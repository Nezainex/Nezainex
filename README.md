I became interested in test automation because I like that automation provides the ability to apply programming to solve testing problems and improve processes. 
In my free time I study new approaches and tools in automation on YouTube and Habr.
##
I use Java (Maven) and Selenide to write automated tests, TestNG to manage tests, and Allure for reporting. 
To automate UI tests I use Selenide, and for API I use the Rest assured library and Postman.
##
In my work, I try to be attentive to details, carefully analyze requirements and always look for the best solutions for test automation. 
I like to learn new things and I am always open to new ideas and approaches.
